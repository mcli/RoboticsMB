#+TITLE: Programming Edison With Event Handlers

* Introduction
  The main program executes when you push the play (triangle) button.
  It is possible to add other programs that respond to different events by
  adding a new event handler to your program to make it less complex 
  and easier to understand.  This tutorial explains how to add and use event 
  handlers to your Edison program.

* Event Handling Primer
  The main program contains the core logic of your probram.  It is delimited 
  by the /Start/ and /End/ icons.  Once the main program
  finishes, the program execution is complete and your robot stops running.  

  With Edison, you can add event handlers, delimited by /Start Event/ and /End Event/
  icons, to react to different conditions that happen.  These conditions are 
  the same conditions that you can specify using
  the /Event Wait/ Flow Icon with the added advantage that they can be executed
  any time the event happens rather than only at a particular point in the
  main program.

  Any time an Event with a handler fires, it interrupts the main program and starts executing
  the event handler code and executes it to completion.  After finishing
  the event handler, the control of the program goes back to the main program.

* Adding a New Event Handler
  1. In Edware, add new events by dragging the /Event/ Flow button (located
     under the /if/ on the command palette) over to the right of the /New
     Event/ icon on your program canvas.
  2. Configure which event you want to trigger this program segment by clicking
     on the /Start Event/ icon and editing its properities.

* Example
   I want Edison to drive straight and beep whenever it detects a line
   (a non-reflective surface) and stop when it detects an obstacle.
   While I could have added some complex logic in the main program to
   do this, it is much simpler by adding a couple of event handlers.
   One to handle the line tracking sensor input and another to handle
   the obstacle sensors inputs.

   To allow event handlers and the main program to communicate with
   one another, I use a variable, /stop/, which I create using the
   /Variable Editor/.  In this case, I want to tell the main program
   to stop when I encounter an obstacle.  I do this by having the loop
   in the main program exit when /stop/ is set to 1.  In the /Variable
   Editor/ I set the initial value of /stop/ to 0.

* Going Beyond the Example
  In this tutorial, we used event handlers to give the robot
  different behaviors (e.g. beep on a line) and to control the main program
  (e.g. set the /stop/ variable to cause the main program to stop).  
  With these basic building blocks, you can have main program elements controlled
  using variables that the event handlers modify.

  Exercises:
  - set the dual drive direction and speed to use variables
    that are set in the obstacle detector event handler.
  - Have the robot be controlled by remote control, but allow the 
    obstacle detector to change the direction to avoid obstacles.
  
* Tips
  - Avoid complex logic and loops in the event handlers.  
  - Set variables and do things quickly in event handlers so that control 
    can return to the main program.
  - You can temporarily disable events while debugging by changing the event to the 
    /keypad/ event so that it doesn't get executed.
  - Test incrementally and save often.
  - Once a program works, save it with a version number and then increment
    the version so you can go back to it if you need to.
  - Add Beeps and/or music to different events so you can hear the event 
    trigger.
