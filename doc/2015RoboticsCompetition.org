    - 8:10 pm Competition results and discussion
* Summary
  1. Transport radioactive plutonium payload from one reactor to another.
  2. Plutonium payload will take the form of a ping pong ball.
  3. Begin and end with a human-controlled segment to load and unload
     the payload.
  4. Autonomously navigate a transport course between the load and unloading areas.
* Terminology
  1. We shall refer to the humans participating in the competition as the /participant(s)/
     and the device as the /robot/.
  2. The /payload/ refers to the ping pong ball in the competition.
  3. The /competition/ refers to each participator's performance in the 
     competition course.
  4. The /over-all competition/ refers to the entire competition with all participants.
  5. The participant's /entry/ into the competition includes the hardware, software (program), 
     and documentation (Engineering Notebook)

* Competition Specifications
** Hardware
   1. The robot shall be programmed by the participants.
   2. The robot shall use one or more processors/boards
   3. Robot shall fit in the plastic box distributed at the first class.
      (8.25"x6.0"x6.5")
** Programming
   1. The robot shall not be re-programmed while the robot is in the competition course.
   2. The source code and/or logic flow for the robots shall be available for judges to review.
   3. The participant may utilize libraries in the program.
   4. If code is copy and pasted from third party sources, the reference must be
      attributed in the code comments.
   5. The core code and logic shall be written by the participant
** Time for Completion
   1. The robot shall complete the course in maximum of 5 minutes.
   2. Bonus points will be awarded for time achieved under 3 minutes.
** Payload
   1. The payload shall be a regulation (non-radioactive) ping pong ball with a diameter
      of 40mm.
   2. The payload shall not be directly touched by the participant.
** Loading/Unloading
   1. The robot shall load payload from an 3-inch high elevated platform.
   2. The robot shall unload the payload onto a 3-inch high elevated platform.
   3. Loading and unloading may be done using manual (human-directed or controlled
      mechanisms).
   4. Loading/unloading mechanism must be part of the robot.  No mechanisms apart
      the robot shall be used.
** Transport Course
   1. The transport course shall be navigated autonomously by the robot.
   2. The payload shall remain with the robot during transport.
   3. The participant shall not manually intervene while the robot is within
      the transport course.
   4. The robot shall not make contact with walls or objects within the 
      transport course.
   5. Obstacles and boundaries of the course will range in height from
      7/8 to 3.5 inches.
** Documentation
   Designs must be documented in your Engineering Notebook and include:
   1. Programming logic
   2. Mechanical/Physical design diagrams/sketches
   3. Circuit diagram
   4. Testing results
      
** Quarantine
   1. The participant shall design a sign identifying his name and his robot's name
      for the quarantine table
   2. All robots and IR controllers will be quarantined 5 minutes before the 
      competition start up until the time the robot is to compete.
   3. All robots and IR controllers will be placed on a quarantine table until
      each participant's competition.
   4. No programming or robot modifications shall be made during the competition.
   5. There will be a one minute period prior to starting competition for
      the active competion participant to adjust and calibrate the robot.
   6. After each competition, the participant's robot must be returned to
      the quarantine table.
   
* Teamwork (optional)
  1. A scout may team up with one other scout. 
  2. Team must be decided by the end of the 2nd class.
  3. Each member of the team must understand how the entire robot operates.

* Scoring
  1. Completion of each segment (Load, transport, Unload) shall be +20 points.
  2. Complete design documentation in Engineering Notebook up to +25 points
     awarded as follows:
     1) Programming logic (+5)
     2) Physical design (+5)
     3) Circuit/Electrical design (+5)
     4) Testing Results (+5)
     5) Neatness/organization (+5)
  3. Bonus Points
     1) Time Bonus
        - +10 for under 3 minutes
        - +20 for under 2 minutes
        - +30 for under 1 minute
     2) Up to +20 points for elegant and innovative design
  4. Point Deductions
     1) Each manual intervention by the participant during transport (-5)
     2) Each payload touch by the participant (-5)
     3) Each contact with obstacles or boundaries in the transport course (-1)
* Judge Panel
  1. Scoring will be done by an impartial judge panel.
  2. During the Design Review phase, the judges will individually
     review each the participant's entries ask the participants questions.
     Time spent with each participant is approximately 3 minutes.
  3. Each judge shall score the competitions individually, marking the score
     for each participant on a score sheet.
  4. At the completion of each competition, the judges will spend up to 2 minutes to 
     agree on the final score for the participant.
  5. Judges will be selected by the Merit Badge Counselor.
